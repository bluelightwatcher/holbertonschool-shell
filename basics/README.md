In this README you'll find a brief descriptions of the scripts.

First of all, the scripts needs to be 2 lines exactly.
All the scripts needs to end with en empty line.
The first line will always start with a shebang in order to "call the bash builtin function"
The second line will be the code itself
In order to create an empty I initially though of using this symbol /n, it is not necessary 

The first script: 0-current_working_directory
runs pwd

The second script: 1-listit
runs ls
